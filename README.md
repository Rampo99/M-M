# Other Informations
This site was developed for the Web Technologies project of the University of Bologna. Personally, I only devoted myself to the server side, design and sockets, while I left the graphics to the other members of the group:
- [Filippo Perrina](https://github.com/Perghio)
- [Marco Spallone](https://github.com/marcospallone)
